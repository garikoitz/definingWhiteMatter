function [fg, keep, SuperFiber]=AFQ_removeFiberOutliers(fg,maxDist,maxLen,numNodes,M,count,maxIter,show)
% Remove fibers from a fiber group that differ substantially from the
% mean fiber in the group.
%
% [fg keep]=AFQ_removeFiberOutliers(fg,maxDist,maxLen,numNodes,[M = 'mean'],[count = 0],[maxIter = 5], [show = 0])
%
% Inputs:
% fg       = input fiber group structure to be cleaned
% maxDist  = the maximum gaussian distance a fiber can be from the core of
%            the tract and be retained in the fiber group
% maxLen   = The maximum length of a fiber (in stadard deviations from the
%            mean length)
% numNodes = Each fiber will be resampled to have numNodes points
% M        = median or mean to represent the center of the tract
% count    = whether or not to print pruning results to screen
% maxIter  = The maximum number of iterations for the algorithm
% show     = whether or not to show which fibers are being removed in each
%            iteration. If show == 1 then the the fibers that are being 
%            kept and removed will be rendered in 3-D and the user will be 
%            prompted to decide whether continue with the cleaning
%
% Outputs:
% fg       = Cleaned fiber group
% keep     = A 1xN vector where n is the number of fibers in the origional
%            fiber group.  Each entry in keep denotes whether that fiber
%            was kept (1) or removed (0).
%
%  Example:
%  AFQdata = '/home/jyeatman/matlab/svn/vistadata/AFQ/';
%  fg = dtiReadFibers(fullfile(AFQdata,'fibers/L_Arcuate_uncleaned.mat'));
%  maxDist = 4; maxLen = 4;
%  numNodes = 25; M = 'mean'; count = 1; show = 1;
%  [fgclean keep]=AFQ_removeFiberOutliers(fg,maxDist,maxLen,numNodes,M,count,show);
%  % Note that the output fgclean will be equivalent to
%  fgclean = dtiNewFiberGroup; fgclean.fibers = fg.fibers(keep);
